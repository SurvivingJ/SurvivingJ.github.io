    <h2>About my self-driven pursuits in Programming</h2>
    <p>
      As a programmer, I pride myself on being innovative, versatile, and problem-solving oriented. 
      My projects range from the AI Council for Idea Generation and Evaluation, showcasing my ability to adapt and extend the capabilities of Large Language Models, 
      to the Tennis Prediction Algorithm, where I applied data science and machine learning to accurately forecast outcomes. I have also developed proficiency in web development, 
      creating both personal and client websites using HTML, CSS, and PHP. My work, including varied projects like AI-generated adventure games and web scrapers, 
      demonstrates my continuous learning approach and my enthusiasm for applying programming skills in diverse, real-world scenarios.</p>

    <h2>AI Council for Idea Generation and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>A system of LLM based bots to generate ideas and subsequently evaluate their logic, rationality and cohesiveness, and determine the best idea. While originally
          intended for generating ideas for Instrumental Variables for econometric analysis, I realised that with some small changes, it would be well adapted to generating
          ideas for any topic, and subsequently evaluating and determining the best one.

        <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        <p>This project was a valuable learning experience in Object Oriented Programming and LLM Prompting. 
          Additionally, it was exciting to tackle a project that uses new technology, was applicable to issues faced in areas of research I studied at University (Instrumental Variable
          idea generation for econometric analysis), and was not simply a derivation of an online tutorial. I look forward to continuing to improve this project.

    <h2>Tennis Prediction Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The project set out with a straightforward yet challenging aim: to build an algorithm that could predict tennis match results. 
            This task was more than just about predictions; it was a chance for me to get hands-on with the pandas library in Python, 
            learn how to clean and handle data effectively, and dip my toes into the practical uses of machine learning. 
            Through a process of trial and error and continuous improvement, the project evolved from a simple concept to a tool that could make sense of detailed data and 
            provide a glimpse into the outcomes of tennis&nbsp;matches. </p>

        <h3> Project Skills </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Use of the pandas library for data manipulation.</li>
                <li> Techniques for cleaning and managing datasets.</li>
                <li> Application of machine learning for predictive modeling.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        <p>This project was a valuable learning experience in data management and machine learning&nbsp;techniques. 
            It culminated in achieving a peak prediction accuracy of 75.32%, where the model successfully forecasted the outcomes of 528 matches within a test dataset comprising 701 contests. 
            This result was attained after excluding outcomes from Version 1, which was identified as significantly overfitted. 
            The insights gained from this endeavor have been instrumental in understanding the critical balance between model complexity and&nbsp;generalizability.

    <h2>Website Construction</h2>
        <p>Firstly, this personal website was built completely by me, giving me a great chance to improve my skills with HTML and CSS. I also originally created a version that used PHP to
          give myself experience using that too.
          Additionally, I developed a comprehensive website for a local beauty salon, utilizing HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
          This project involved constructing the site from scratch, closely aligning its design with the salon's existing brand identity.
